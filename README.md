# River Crossing
River crossing is a game based on logical riddles.<br/>
To solve the riddles you have to get all the characters -preferably, in the fewest trips- from one river bank to another,
respecting all the riddle rules.

## Missionaries and Cannibals Riddle.
Three missionaries and three cannibals want to get to the other side of a river. There is a small boat, which can fit only two. 
To prevent a tragedy, there can never be more cannibals than missionaries together.<br/>
Run [Missionaries and Cannibals.pl](https://github.com/BouSenna/RiverCrossing/blob/master/Missionaries%20and%20Cannibals/Missionaries%20and%20Cannibals.pl) 
by giving prolog a `cross_the_river(Moves).` goal.
